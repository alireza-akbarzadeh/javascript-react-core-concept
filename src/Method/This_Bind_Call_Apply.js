// A DOM Event Handler
// In the browser, there is a special this context for event handlers. In an event handler called by addEventListener, this will refer to event.currentTarget. More often than not, developers will simply use event.target or event.currentTarget as needed to access elements in the DOM, but since the this reference changes in this context, it is important to know.
// In the following example, weâ€™ll create a button, add text to it, and append it to the DOM. When we log the value of this within the event handler, it will print the target.
